# Prabhakar Regmi

Hi! My name is Prabhakar Regmi. I am a self-taught developer, and have been working as a software developer, primarily in C++, since 2012. I consider myself as a problem-solver - and have a keen eye and curious mind to learn new technologies fast, and apply it. I am mostly interested in algorithm design and application to solve real world problems. 

I have had a multi-national and multi-cultural experience. I completed my high-schooling from (Rato Bangala school)(https://www.ratobangala.edu.np/) in Nepal. Then, I went to Bremen, Germany, to pursue my bachelor's in Physics - at the (Jacobs University Bremen)(https://www.jacobs-university.de/). After my Bachelor of Science degree, I came to Toronto, Canada to pursue my master's in Computational Fluid Dynamics. I studied at the (University of Toronto)(https://www.utoronto.ca/) (Institute of Aerospace Studies)(https://www.utias.utoronto.ca/). After graduating from the University of Toronto in 2012, I have been continously working as a software developer.
